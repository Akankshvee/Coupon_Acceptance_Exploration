## Description
This project is used to explore panadas, visualization and data analysis techniques. The data comes from UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Data Analysis about drivers who accepted Bar coupons

### Observations
<ol>
<li>41% of bar coupon was accepted.</li>
<li>61.67% was accepted by people who went to the bar 3 or fewer times.</li>
<li>18.5% was accepted by people who went to the bar more than 3 times.</li>

<li>Interestingly, 35.3% of the drivers who accept the coupon have no kids and do not work in Farming, Fishing or Forestry.</li>
<li>35.3% of acceptance is also satisfied by people who are not widowed. Indicating, widowed people who go to bar less than once a month, don't accept the coupon.</li>
